# Control Table

The Control Table pattern is also known as a **table-driven method**.

## Intent

Control tables are a scheme that allows you to look up information in a table rather than using logic statements (if and case) to determine the appropriate control flow. It allows one to simplify complex logic, and can make maintaining logic simpler and more explicit.
