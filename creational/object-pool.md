# Object (Resource) Pool

## Intent

Improve performance and memory usage by reusing objects from a fixed pool of memory instead of allocating them individually. It allows objects that are expensive to create to be shared. It is most effective in situations where the cost of initializing an instance is high, the rate of instantiation is high, and the number of instantiations in use at any one time is low.
